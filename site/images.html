When you are in imagination, the ether, source of gravity that lies in your physical body on earth gathers data from a different timeline of different specifications. Gravity defies time and hence it has everything from everywhere, but the amount of ether and the timeline that ether carries around defines your thoughts and talents. Don't worry, when you die and when your ether gets mixed with some better ether and enters into another physical body, you might be someone you want to be. &quot;</div>
